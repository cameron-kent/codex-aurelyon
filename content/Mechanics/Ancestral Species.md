# Specie Categories

## Primary
The Primary races constitute the backbone of civilization in Aurelyon, forming the majority of its populous societies and laying the foundation for its cultural, political, and economic structures. These races have deep-rooted histories within the world, often tracing their lineage back to ancient civilizations or legendary origins. Their presence permeates the surface realms of Aurelyon, where they have established flourishing cities, kingdoms, and empires. While they may have diverse cultures and ideologies, they share a common heritage of dominance in the world's affairs.

## Bestial
Bestial races exhibit a unique blend of intelligence and primal instincts, standing apart from the mundane beasts with whom they share physical traits. Despite their animalistic appearances, they possess the capacity for speech, reason, and societal organization. Living in settlements of their own creation, these races carve out niches in the world, often harmonizing with nature or harnessing their primal instincts to pursue diverse lifestyles. While some may still maintain a close connection to their wild roots, others embrace sophisticated cultures, arts, and traditions.

## Monstrous
The Monster races inhabit the fringes of civilization, often regarded with fear, suspicion, or disdain by the more conventional societies of Aurelyon. Though endowed with intelligence and the ability to communicate, they frequently struggle against stereotypes of aggression or savagery perpetuated by their appearances or histories. Many Monster races find themselves marginalized or forced into the wilderness, where they form their own enclaves or societies, sometimes adopting survivalist or tribal lifestyles. Despite these challenges, some individuals from these races strive to defy expectations and integrate into mainstream society, seeking understanding and acceptance.

## Mutated
Mutated races undergo a profound transformation during pivotal stages of their development, diverging from the norms of their ancestral species. These transformations can manifest in physical, mental, or even magical alterations, often occurring during childhood or adolescence, reshaping their identities and capabilities. While some view these mutations as curses or aberrations, others embrace them as gifts or unique expressions of their destinies. Mutated individuals navigate a complex relationship with their past and present selves, grappling with questions of identity, belonging, and acceptance within their communities.

## Extra Planar
Extra Planar races hail from [[03. Planes#e'Fae'rëal & Umbrafall|realms]] beyond the material plane of Aurelyon, bringing with them exotic cultures, customs, and perspectives shaped by their otherworldly origins. Whether from the ethereal beauty of the e'Fae'rëal or the shadowy depths of the Umbrafall, these races embody the mysteries and wonders of distant dimensions. Their presence in Aurelyon may be fleeting or enigmatic, tied to cosmic events, arcane rituals, or personal quests. Some seek to explore and understand the material plane, forging alliances or rivalries with its inhabitants, while others remain aloof, observing the mortal realm from afar. Regardless of their intentions, Extra Planar races leave an indelible mark on Aurelyon's history, shaping its fate in ways both subtle and profound.

º *These species are almost exclusively found within the Netherdark of Aurelyon.*

### Half Species

In the realm of creatures, hybrids born of differing species—be they Standard, Bestial, or Monster—possess a unique blend of traits inherited from each parent race, melding the aesthetic qualities and attributes of both parents. This phenomenon while rare, gives rise to a diverse array of half-offspring, each bearing a distinctive fusion of physical characteristics and abilities drawn from their lineage.

##### When Creating A Half-Specie
Take from:
* Physical appearance / Aesthetics of one or both parents
* The Mechanical attributes of a single parent, or a combination approved by DM
