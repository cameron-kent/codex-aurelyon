## Prelude

> *As the night envelops the world outside, you find yourselves nestled within the confines of a cramped carriage, your bodies contorted in uncomfortable positions in a futile attempt to find rest. The rhythmic sway of the carriage lulls you into a fitful slumber, but your respite is short-lived.*
> 
> *Abruptly, a jolt rips through the carriage as if the very earth beneath you has risen up in protest. The grinding of metal against stone pierces the silence, sending shivers down your spines as you are violently thrust from your uneasy sleep. With a collective gasp, your eyes snap open, blinking away the remnants of sleep as you struggle to regain your bearings.*
> 
> *Outside, the darkness looms, punctuated only by the dim glow of distant stars. The world beyond the carriage window is a blur of shadows and uncertainty, the landscape passing by in a blur as the carriage lurches forward.*

## The Village And Keep

>*The village is nestled within the somber embrace of the Frostwood, its buildings huddled closely together as if seeking solace in their collective presence. The air is thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional creak of wooden structures or the distant howl of the wind. Crumbling cottages line narrow streets, their timeworn facades bearing scars of hardship. The pervasive gloom is accentuated by the ever-present mist that clings to the ground like a shroud.*
>
>*At the heart of the village stands the alderman's imposing stone keep, a stark contrast to the humble dwellings that surround it. Its formidable walls rise defiantly against the encroaching darkness. The keep's watchful gaze looms over the village like a silent sentinel, casting a long shadow that seems to swallow the feeble rays of sunlight that dare to pierce the gloom.*
>
>*Despite the palpable sense of fear and despair that hangs heavy in the air, there are signs of life amidst the desolation. Flickering torches cast dancing shadows upon the worn faces of villagers as they scurry about their routines, their weary eyes betraying a sense of resignation tempered by fleeting glimpses of hope. In the distance, the rhythmic sound of axes striking wood echoes through the forest.*

* The Keep is guarded outside by 4 man-at-arms
* Inside the Alderman keeps 4 Elite guards near his person at all times.

## The Alderman

> ![[Barnabus Grimshaw.jpg|left|350|350]]*Alderman Barnabus Grimshaw cuts an imposing figure, his massive frame straining against the confines of his elaborate finery. His bloated form spills over the edges of his ornate chair, the rich velvet cushions groaning under his weight. Dressed in ostentatious robes adorned with gaudy jewels and intricate embroidery, he exudes an air of self-importance that borders on arrogance.*
> 
> *Beneath heavy, sweat-streaked jowls, his beady eyes gleam with avarice, darting about with an unsettling intensity as he speaks. Thick rolls of flesh cascade down his neck like a waterfall of excess, each crease and fold a testament to a life of indulgence and decadence. His meaty hands, adorned with jeweled rings that glitter in the dim light of the keep, gesture grandly as he issues commands with the authority of a monarch.*

* If the party questions the Alderman's authenticity, a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check will reveal the following.

>*Despite his outward display of wealth and power, there is something decidedly off-putting about Alderman Grimshaw. His voice, a low rumble that reverberates through the chamber like distant thunder, carries an undercurrent of menace that belies his jovial demeanor. There is a darkness lurking behind his oily smile, a hunger that transcends mere physical appetite—a hunger for power, control, and dominion over all that lies within his grasp.*

* Speaking with the Alderman he tells the party that the beast, a monstrous wolf looms to attack and its home is somewhere in the wood, and to hurry off and slay it.
* The Alderman agrees to any payments or bonuses to expedite the process and is overly eager to see the wolfs head brought to him.

## The Job

* The players can seek to resolve the job by whatever avenue they seem fit.
* Investigating around town the can learn the history of the village with no checks.
>The village, established by Alderman Barnabus Grimshaw, thrived initially as lumberjacks heedlessly harvested the surrounding forest, disregarding the warnings of fae spirits. However, tragedy struck in the first frostveil as a giant wolf, ravaged the village, leaving death and destruction in its wake.
>The second year the Alderman returned this time building large wooden palisades to deter any beast from attacking. Yet again as frostveil fell, the wolf returned.

* The players can investigate the Frostwood, as the move from the village, they see the signs of lumber harvest and destroyed signs of fae life such as mushroom circles.
* The players can find fae spirits in the form of animals that will speak to the party. They will inform them of this forests connection to the e'Fae'rëal and that the Alderman was warned if he cut down the trees that it would anger the guardian spirit.
