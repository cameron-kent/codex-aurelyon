*Lawful Good, Tiefling, He/Him*

![[Dread.jpg|right|300|300]]
#### Description
Gildire's childhood was marked by the abrupt onset of his Tiefling mutation, a transformation that began at the tender age of 8, much younger than typical for his kind. The once-promising scion of a noble High Elf family, he found himself cast into a world of ostracism and fear as his peers and elders recoiled from his altered form. Even his own family, once revered for their status and influence, faced scorn and ridicule, their noble seat stripped away as they were banished to the fringes of society. In the face of such adversity, Gildire forged a new identity for himself, shedding his birth name and adopting the moniker "Dread" as a testament to the pervasive sense of fear and apprehension that had come to define his existence. This name served as a reminder of the prejudice he endured and the judgment he aimed to invoke upon those who dared to look down upon him.

Despite the hardships he faced, Dread's spirit remained unbroken, his resolve unwavering in the face of adversity. Guided by his newfound faith in [[Erathis]], the goddess of civilization and order, he embarked on a path of righteous crusade, wielding the mantle of paladinhood as a beacon of justice and righteousness. In Erathis's name, he sought to champion the cause of order and stability, standing as a stalwart defender of those who suffered under the yoke of chaos and lawlessness. With each oath he swore and each foe he vanquished, Dread sought to reclaim his dignity and honor, forging a new legacy for himself that transcended the limitations of his past.
