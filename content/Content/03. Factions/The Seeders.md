#### About
![[The Seeders.jpg|right|250|250]]The Seeders are a revered order of druids and nature enthusiasts dedicated to preserving the balance of the natural world and fostering growth and harmony among all living beings. Rooted in ancient traditions and guided by the wisdom of the earth itself, they tend to the forests, meadows, and rivers of Aurelyon with a deep reverence and stewardship. Their headquarters, hidden deep within the heart of the largest forest, serves as a sanctuary for both flora and fauna, where they gather to commune with nature and share their knowledge with the next generation of caretakers.
#### Goals
**Environmental Conservation:** The Seeders work tirelessly to protect natural habitats from deforestation, pollution, and other forms of environmental degradation, advocating for sustainable practices and responsible stewardship of the land.

**Cultivation of Life:** Through rituals and ceremonies, the Seeders strive to promote the growth and vitality of plant life across Aurelyon, planting trees, nurturing gardens, and rejuvenating barren landscapes to ensure the continued abundance of resources for all creatures.

**Harmony with Wildlife:** The Seeders seek to foster peaceful coexistence between sentient beings and the creatures of the wild, mediating conflicts and facilitating communication between humans, elves, dwarves, and the denizens of the forest.
