## Rule of the Many

#### Democracy
Rule by the People – “_The will of the majority”_

A form of government in which power is vested in the people. In larger nations, this is through freely elected representatives, although some forms of “direct” democracy exist in smaller form (majority rule), where people vote directly on legislation as a single body. There are various ways to go about a democracy, depending on the size of the group of people, the people representing themselves, and how their power is expressed.

- **REAL:** _Most of the Western Hemisphere, Ancient Greece, Switzerland (direct)_
- **FICTION:** _The Free Cities (Game of Thrones), United Earth (Star Trek)_

#### Republic
Rule by Representatives– “_A balance of power”_

Republics are ruled by elected individuals, whose duty is to represent the needs of their citizens, and exercise power on behalf of the people, according to the law of the land. Often times, these representatives are part of a house, parliament, or divided structure with multiple elected leaders. The kinds of republics often depend on how much power the representatives have vs. the public, and how those representatives are divided.

- **REAL:**  _Roman Republic, Free Imperial Cities (Holy Roman Empire), USA, UK, France, Germany_
- **FICTION:** _Galactic Republic (Star Wars), Adro (Powder Mage Trilogy)_

#### Democratic Republic
Rule for the People – “_Liberty for all”_

A familiar cross-section between “democracy” and “republic”. A representative democracy which people elect the representatives, and the representatives have the power to exercise the enacting of legislation. Here, you see a balance of power where “majority rule” is offset by the representation of the minority, in order to allow all groups of people to have power. (Incidentally, many countries in the real world use this term, while being undemocratic or authoritarian.)

- **REAL:** _United States of America, Germany, South Korea, Ethiopia, Taiwan_
- **FICTION:** _City of Elendel (Alloy of Law: Mistborn Era 2), Baldurs Gate (Forgotten Realms)_

#### Federation/Confederation
Rule of the States– _“Many as one, together or apart.”_  

A group of several states which are members within a larger union, which decide on legislation for the broader entity.  
  
In a **federation**, the central authority is a federal government which holds the overall authority, where the states are subordinate to it. This allows overall control over diplomatic, economic, military, and legal issues.

- **REAL:** _Germany, USA, Russia_
- **FICTION:** _United Federation of Planets (Star Trek)_

In a **confederation**, the federal government is weaker and accountable to the member states, who are the true authority. These states can negotiate on joint foreign policy, and defensive matters. However, the rest is up to the states individually.

- **REAL:** _CSA, Confederation of the Rhine_
- **FICTION:** _Terran Confederacy (Starcraft)_

## Rule of the Few

#### Oligarchy
Rule by the Few – “_Will of the minority”_

Considered an umbrella term for a society with a few, self-appointed rulers, dominating over a significantly larger body of citizens. This comes in a wide variety of forms, depending on what group is considered the ruling class. Throughout history, class systems gave way to prejudice of those of lower class, and privilege amongst those of higher status. In rare situations, this system was preferred over a single autocratic ruler. In most cases, however, this recognized rights only for the few, and authoritarian rule over the many.

- **REAL:** _England (Magna Carta, 1215), Russian Empire, Iran, Saudi Arabia_
- **FICTION:** _Waterdeep/Masked Lords (Forgotten Realms)_

#### Aristocracy
Rule by Heirs – “_Let them eat cake”_

Referring to nobility, this government puts power in the hands of a small, privileged few who inherit their status from birth. Often time, this is not as a system of government itself, but as a mingling of the highest classes in a society which often includes the rich, powerful, and ruling class. A society where those of high birth have significant rights and privileges over the “unwashed” masses.

- **REAL:** _Saudi Arabia, French Nobility (pre-1790), Russian Nobility, English Nobility_
- **FICTION:** _The Houses of Game of Thrones_

#### Theocracy
Rule by Religion – “_Alpha and Omega”_

A government ruled by divine guidance, or individuals who are divinely guided. Often times, leaders are members of a clergy, priesthood, or religious sect. This can come in many forms: the state and religion are one entity, the leader(s) are chosen by a god (or are considered gods), laws are enforced based upon scripture and sacred traditions, mandating of divine or occult worship, etc. The masses must worship to the decree of the clergy-class, and non-believers are of the lowest class, often persecuted.

- **REAL:** _Ancient Egypt, Byzantine Empire, Holy See (Vatican), Calphates, Shang Dynasty_
- **FICTION:** _Dune (Dune), Magisterium (His Dark Materials), Air Nomads (Avatar: the Last Airbender), Jedi Council (Star Wars), The Covenant (Halo Series)_

#### Plutocracy
Rule by the Rich – “_Greed is good”_

A society which is ruled or controlled by those of great wealth or income. This can be conducted as direct rule, by dominating influence over rulers by way of economic power, or by consolidating wealth and using it to control markets directly. Elites come to power through unshared rapid economic growth, or through hoarding diminishing resources and wealth. To remain in power, shifts in trade and economics are played to the plutarchs advantage.

- **REAL:** _USA (Gilded Age, Today), Merchant Republics (Venice, Florence), Carthage, Kingdom of France (pre-revolution)_
- **FICTION:** _Panem (The Hunger Games)_

## Rule of Authority

#### Absolute Monarchy
Rule of Royalty – “_Divine right of kings”_

The age-old, royal legacy of the monarch ruling class. Perhaps the most common form of autocracy in history, and especially the “fantasy” genre.

Considered the “traditional” form of monarchy, the anointed sovereign holds supreme authority, not restricted by written laws or customs. These rulers possess “divine right” to enact their rule how they see fit. More often than not, succession is hereditary, centered on a house or family line. Kings/Queens are tended to by their subjects with servitude, and their reign is considered the will of God.

- **REAL:** _Ancient Egypt (Pharaohs), House of Habsburg, France (Louis XIV), England (Charles I)_
- **FICTION:** _Robert/Jeoffrey Baratheon (Game of Thrones), Aragorn (Lord of the Rings)_

#### Constitutional Monarchy
Limited Rule of Royalty – “For _King and Country”_

As ages passed, and the enlightenment approached, revolutions demanded a limit to the power of kings. 

Unlike an absolute monarchy, the monarchs authority is derived from, or legally bound, by a constitution or legislature. This rule is executive in power, but may be counterbalanced with a parliament or council of other leaders. Sometimes, this is symbolic only. This can be hereditary, or an elected position.

- **REAL:** _United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Japan_
- **FICTION:** _Breland (Ebberon), Queen Amidala (Star Wars)_

#### Fascism
Rule by Dictatorship – “_Might is Right”_

A form of authoritarian government characterized by extreme national identity and forcible oppression of opposition. This system is ruled by a dictator of whom is the premiere image of national pride. Opposition accounts for groups of people who do not fit the national (or ethnic) identity, and foreigners of any sort. This is often enforced by militaristic, strong-man attitudes, and considering a certain people “superior” either in nation, culture, or ethnicity.

- **REAL:** _Nazi Germany, Axis Italy, Saddam’s Iraq_
- **FICTION:** _Norsefire Party (V for Vendetta), Pacific States of America (The Man in the High Castle), Terran Federation (Starship Troopers)_

#### Empire
Rule by Expansion– “_The Sun Never Sets”_

An extensive group of states, countries, and territories under a single supreme authority. This government is characterized by expansionism, the conquering of lands, establishing of colonies, and ruling over peoples of various cultures. In earlier times, this expanse was ruled by a single individual (emperor, empress, czar, tsar), but eventually the definition changed to include colonial empires in which the host nation itself was the authority.

- **REAL:** _Roman Empire, British Empire, Ottoman Empire, Qing Dynasty, Umayyad Caliphate, Aztec Empire_
- **FICTION:** _The Imperium (Warhammer 40k), Fire Nation (Avatar: The Last Airbender), Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Broddring Empire (Eragon: Inheritance Cycle)_

#### Autocracy
Rule by Only One – _“I am Ozymandias, King of Kings.”_

A system of government ruled by one with absolute power. This can be a single person, or party. Decisions of this entity are not subject to legal constraints or popular control of any sort. Leaders are treated with fear, grandeur, and imagery of supreme power. With this said, most still require a power structure to rule, including military, nobles, and other elite groups. Succession is most often hereditary, or through conquering or revolt.

- **REAL:** _Roman Empire (Augustus Caesar), England (King John), Imperial Russia (Tsar), French Empire (Napoleon)_
- **FICTION:** _Emperor Palpatine (Star Wars), The White Witch (Chronicles of Narnia), The Governor (The Walking Dead)_

#### Totalitarian
Limitless Rule – _“Big brother is watching.”_

A political system which recognizes no limits in its authority, and strives to rule every aspect of the public and private life of its citizens. This can be under the power of a single person, faction or class. This is an extensive and pervasive method of rule usually guided by ideology, as the totality of the authority and the ideology can not be questioned. Enforcing such a realm requires near constant surveillance and control. Extreme authoritarianism.

- **REAL:** _USSR, Nazi Germany, North Korea_
- **FICTION:** _Oceania (1984), World State (Brave New World)_

## Revolutionary / Contested Rule

#### Communism
Rule for Redistribution– _“Seize the means of production.”_

A socio-economic system where all property is communally owned. Each citizen receives a share of the resources based upon their needs. This emerges as a revolutionary ideology, and becomes the basis of a governments economic policy. Communism is not explicit to a type of rule. Ideologically, it strives to be a “state-less” system. However, historically, this system has been accompanied by governments with a single-party autocracy.

- **REAL:** _USSR, China, North Korea_
- **FICTION:** _Thu (The Dispossessed), Arstotska (Papers, Please), Eurasia (1984)_

#### Anarchy
Struggle against Rule – _“Down with the system.”_

In most definitions, anarchy is a state of disorder due to the absence or nonrecognition of authority. However, anarchy is also a movement of liberation or revolt against a government or set hierarchy, rather than just a destination ideology. Anarchists exist in settings where centralized forms of government rule in contrast, where citizen unrest is growing and intensifying.

- **REAL:** _Revolutionary Catalonia, Free Territory (Ukraine 1918), Democratic Federation of Northern Syria_
- **FICTION:** _V (V for Vendetta), Survivorism (Mistborn Series), Rocky Mountain States (The Man in the High Castle)_

#### Military Coup / Junta
Rule by Overthrow – _“I am the revolution”_

Typically, when an uprising or coup occurs, the victor party becomes its own provisional government. Unlike a stratocracy, this rule is historically short-lived and the legitimacy of the new rulers is in a contested state. The formation of a proceeding government is necessary, but is pending organization, infrastructure, or the end of hostilities. The coup is often violent, but can be peaceful, such as part of a civil emergency.

- **REAL:** _Spain (Napoleonic Wars), German Empire (mid-WWI), Various declarations of Martial Law_
- **FICTION:** _StateSec (Honor Harrington Series), Aslon (Legend of Asahiel Series)_

## Traditional Forms

#### Feudalism
Rule of Lords and Kings – “_All according to their station”_

A social system in which the nobility hold land  from a king in exchange for military service. Down the chain, commoners (peasants/serfs) lived on their lord’s land in service to them. Peasants were provided military protection, and obligated to perform labor, provide a share of the produce, and pay homage. This relationship between lord and peasant is also referred to as **Manorialism**.

In short, society was structured around the holding of land in exchange for service and labor. During the enlightenment, this way of living came into challenge by revolutions and evolving political theory. At the same time, many critics suggest that the economic system of today still shares similarity to feudalism.

Most medieval fantasy fiction sets place in a vaguely feudal society, but some are more historically accurate than others.

- **REAL:** _Medieval Europe, Asia, and the Middle East_
- **FICTION:** _Westeros (Game of Thrones), Nottingham (Robin Hood), Feredlen (Dragon Age: Origins)_

#### Kritarchy
Rule by Judgement– “_We are the law”_

A form of government dependent on judges. This is a traditional system based on customary law, rather that statutory law. This means rather relying on independent written laws, the law is passed by oral tradition, and open to the interpretation. While a majority of citizens might broadly agree on those laws, it is up to the judges to rule upon those laws. 

This grants a broad sense of freedom since there are no concrete statutes to follow (like taxation). However, depending on the customs, the law may still require obligations from its citizens. Also, judges may be considered the ruling class, absent of any judgement upon themselves, or may not be any different from citizens, adhering to the same laws.

- **REAL:**  _Somalia, Ancient Israel (Old Testament), Ancient Ireland (Druids), Frisia_
- **FICTION:** _Mega-City One (Judge Dredd)_

#### Tribalism
Rule by Small Groups – “_Birds of a feather”_

A state, or lifestyle organized into tribes, clans, or small groups of individuals within a closed network, often sharing a cultural identity. Loyalty to the social group is key to membership, and its customs dictate the rules of the tribe.  Tribes may function as small governments within a larger one, or within an environment away from government, either as part of a hermitage or coven of privacy.

Tribes may also refer to the conformity between groups of people. This “way of being” may refer to those of similar occupations or habits. However, any closed circle in tribalism means limited contact with the outside, resulting in limited education and understanding of the broader world.

- **REAL:** Tribes of Israel, Souix, Cherokee, Bedouin, Masai, Ainus, Zulu
- **FICTION:** The Wildlings (Game of Thrones), Dúnedain Rangers (Lord of the Rings), Southern Water Tribe (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

#### Timocracy
Rule of the Honorable– _“Veni, vedi, vici”_  

This is a war-like and honor-bound society where only those who possess land may participate in the government, and the ambition for honor, power, and military glory motivates the rulers. Civic honor and political power increases with the amount of property one owns. It is an oligarchy which is not strictly defined by the “inheritance” of an aristocracy, or the “absolute wealth” of a plutocracy (although often times, can become one of these two forms). You may imagine a society which is run by “houses”, regardless of whether they are noble, gained by wealth, or obtained deeds of “honor”, such as efforts in a military campaign. All other citizens are laborers, and exempt from making decisions.

Intellectuals are discouraged from office, as the love for honor is greater than reason. It prefers simpler characters with plenty of spirit, better suited for war than peace.

- **REAL:** _Sparta, Athens, Chivalry of the Middle Ages, Samurai_
- **FICTION:** _Klingons (Star Trek), Nords (The Elder Scrolls)_

#### Gerontocracy
Rule of the Old – “_The Elders are Watching”_

A system where society is ruled by the elders, or eldest. Some forms are habitual, meaning that it’s leaders tend towards the elder age group, while others are mandated, requiring a minimum age to qualify. It is common to find gerontocracies in cultures that value experience and wisdom as paramount, such as in theocracies.

While traditional, it can take a more modern or futuristic spin. A system that generally honors the old over the new can fit this bill. This form can be seen throughout history, but in fiction, can also exist in dystopian societies where lifespans are increased for the few, and kept short for the many. The most extreme fictional example might see immortals as the few, and mortals as the many.

- **REAL:** _Sparta (The Gerousia), The Vatican, Saudi Arabia, Roman Senate_
- **FICTION:** _Various Vampire Novels, Capitol (The Worthing Saga)_

#### Diarchy / Triumvirate
Rule by Two or Three – _“Together, we shall rule”_

A diarchy is a government characterized by “co-rule” between two individuals of equal or competing power. Rulers can either be of the same status (two kings, queens), or be of separate rank where their powers are separated (king and a religious leader). A lawful diarchy may hold this system as a tradition that survives through generations, and relies solely on mutual co-operation. However, a “de facto” diarchy might mean that both rulers are actively contesting each-other for supreme rule.

A government ruled by three entities is referred to as a Triumvirate. While less common than a diarchy, the separation of powers allow for more executive decision-making within a consolidated power structure. 

- **REAL:** _Roman Republic (Two Consuls, First Triumvirate), Japan (Shogunate), British India, Andorra,_
- **FICTION:** _King + High Sparrow (Game of Thrones), Ynnead (Warhammer), Darth Vader + Emperor (Star Wars),_

## Non-Traditional Forms

#### Socialism
Rule for Public, not Private – “_Redistribution of wealth”_

Not a government itself, but a set of policies aimed towards the redistribution of resources to the public, as opposed to private individuals. This often comes as a response to societies which wealth and privilege is tilted too far toward a single group of people, and promotes the flow of resources to the broader populace. The spectrum of leftist formats vary, but they all share an opposition against imperialist power structures and economics, and a support of collectivism.

Socialist and leftist societies are most likely to be seen in sci-fi, since fantasy is often rife with feudal, imperial, or oligarchical governments that are pre-industrial. 

- **REAL:** _Takes various forms, ranging from democratic (Denmark, Norway) to libertarian (Anarcho-Syndicalist movement), and authoritarian (China, USSR)._
- **FICTION:** KSR’s Mars Trilogy, The Star Fraction, 

#### Technocracy
Rule by the Skilled – “_The Machine of Society”_

A government which elevates the talented, skilled, and intelligent into positions of authority. It idealizes the state as a machine, and professes that scientists, engineers, and the highly educated are best to rule, while the rest remained as workers in a class characterized by job specialization and rationed resources.

A technocratic society is one that advocates for scientific method over superstition or religion. These states are referred to as “technates”. These experts are often appointed, rather than elected.

- **REAL:** _Singapore, USSR (Leonid Brezhnev), Movement in the US during the Great Depression (1930’s)_
- **FICTION:** _The Institute (Fallout 4)_

#### Cyberocracy
Rule by AI – _“My Logic is Undeniable”_

A government that rules by the effective use of information. This system is centered on a complex method of communication (such as inter-connected computer networks) that directly pairs problems with their solvers. The purpose is to address the flaws of “bureaucracy” altogether, which can be a source of corruption, inefficiency, and small power struggles that detract from the solving of problems. Human beings making the decisions create countless inefficiencies which an super-intelligent network, or A.I. system can excel at. 

This automated form of government is theoretical, as there have been no actual cyberocracies to date. However, such a system could open the door to new forms of democracy, oligarchy, or authoritariansim. This can assist human progress, or hinder it. The risk of a “rogue AI” or “singularity event” is also a factor.

- **REAL:** _No governments to date._ 
- **FICTION:** _Neuromancer, The Matrix, I,Robot, Skynet (Terminator), Portal_

#### Stratocracy
Rule by the Enlisted – “We Few, We Band of Brothers/Sisters_”_

A government ran by chiefs of the military, centered on jurisdictional legalism, carried out by enlisted officers. Unlike a military dictatorship or junta, this is a stable government with full administrative, judicial, and legislative processes. All of these are supported by the law, constitution, and the society as a whole.

Interestingly, this system does not necessarily need to be autocratic or oligarchic. However, it is centered on military service as a precursor to citizenship, and that citizenship is required to elect or govern.

- **REAL:** _Myanmar (1997-2011), Roman Empire (Punic Wars), Ancient Sparta, The Cossacks_
- **FICTION:** _Cardassian Union (Star Trek), Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Terran Federation (Starship Troopers), Amestris (Fullmetal Alchemist), Earth Nation (Avatar, the Last Airbender)_

#### Geniocracy
Rule by the Intelligent – “Knowledge is power, literally._”_

This government places the very intelligent at the top of the ruling class. Among these would be scientists, sociologists, and geniuses of high IP (Intellectual Potential), regardless of race or social class. Mandated tests would be taken to ascertain the IP of the populace, placing the top 20% as the electorate, and the top 0.5% as the electable.

The mission of such a society is focused on a one-world government, eradicating violence, emphasizing fulfillment of the genii, and saving humanity from itself. However, while addressing the challenge of intelligence and a basis of scientific thinking, it values raw intelligence over practical-use intelligence, and also does not address ethics in scientific progress or leadership, which could result in IP-driven classism, persecution, or even eugenics.

- **REAL:** _No government, but high-IQ organizations like Mensa International do exist._
- **FICTION:** World State (Brave New World)

#### Noocracy
Rule by the Mind – “Infinity, ahead and behind._”_

A social or political system ruled by an “aristocracy of the wise”, a caste of philosopher kings. This society heralds shared wisdom, based on the priority of human mind. This differs from a geniocracy by not valuing raw intelligence, but the practical and political intelligence to steer humanity through the turbulent waters of the future and into a new golden age.

However, this thinking is directly opposed to democracy, which is considered a system of irrational (and emotional) consensus. Instead, it presumes citizens to not have the knowledge necessary to achieve their aims, and otherwise do not know any better. No elected politicians. Its best to let the wizened experts assume control.

This idea is seen in science fiction more than fantasy. This idea can take multiple forms, such as a non-fundamentalist theocracy, a technocracy that emphasizes experience and awareness over talent, a collective of mind-linked brains, or an extra-terrestrial entity whose mission is to guide humanity.

- **REAL:** _Purely theoretical._
- **FICTION:** _The Traveler (Destiny Series)_, _Helios (Deus Ex)_

#### Demarchy
Rule by Lottery – “_Pick a card. Any card.”_

Also referred to as “Sortition”, this is a unique kind of democracy which is based on random lottery. Not everyone has power, but everyone is eligible to be selected. In some variations, this is administered as a direct democracy, taking random poll from a populace. In others, it is less democratic, the eligible belonging to a specific class or status, or are gathered to vote representatives rather than engage in direct policy making.

This form has been preferred in situations when only a small voting body is needed, and there is intense desire to combat aristocracy, or avoid corruption, favoritism, or bribery. However, being that it is random, there is a chance as always to either have less than desirable effects, or it be used to obscure bribery or corruption further by “adjusting” the chance of a certain group being picked.

- **REAL:** _Legal systems, and law court juries (Jury Duty), Italian City States (Great Councils)_
- **FICTION:** _The Demarchy (Revelation Space), Thalassa (Songs of Distant Earth), Martian Lower House (Blue Mars)_

#### Magocracy
Rule by Mages– “Expelliarmus_“_

An oligarchical organization ruled by the most prominent of mages and spell-casters. This society holds those of magical ability as higher birth and higher privilege, either alongside other aristocracy, or over the mundane altogether. In some cases, only those who can wield magic have a voice in government. One is most likely to see a magocracy at work alongside academies, magical schools, or societies which are ruled by powerful wizards.

The society may rely on the type of magic which is most prominent. Mastery in divine magic may be treated similar to a theocracy, where arcane prowess might see parallels to a geniocracy. Mundane citizens may be lowly regarded or persecuted.

Naturally, this is a fantastical sort of government, so no real-world examples exist.

- **FICTION:** _Ministry of Magic (Harry Potter), Tevinter Imperium (Dragon Age), Merilon (Darksword Trilogy)_


## Decadent Forms

#### Despotism / Tyrrany
Rule by Cruelty – _“Crush your enemies.”_

Typically characterizing the crueler nature of a authoritarian government, a tyranny is a state that oppresses its citizens. This can be by depriving freedoms, opportunities, welfare, resources, or things essential to life and prosperity. This can also include acts of violence, destruction, or torture.

Despotism refers to governments ruled by a single supreme entity, often known for their brutality and cruelty. This entity is most often a person, but can depict a group, party, faction, organization that flexes their power with disregard to human life.

You may often see tyrannical regimes or despotic rulers target or neglect a people, or groups of people within their realm.  

- **REAL:** _Nazi Germany (Hitler), Roman Empire (Caligula), Oliver Cromwell, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the Impaler_
- **FICTION:** _Lord Ruler (Mistborn: The Final Empire), Sauron (Lord of the Rings), Thanos (Marvel Comics)_

#### Kleptocracy
Rule of Thieves – _“Two for me, none for you.”_

A system that is either ruled by thieves, or is stooped in (or encourages) thievery. Conspiracy, theft, and corruption is at the epicenter of government, and its victors are those who overcome the banditry and scheming come out on top. Naturally, depending on whether the environment is within a known den of thievery, or amongst the daylight, thieves may or may not admit to such a thing, so it is rare to see a “Kleptocracy” out in the open. Secrecy and information is of the highest of value to an individuals prosperity and survival. Coin in the right hands, words in the right ear, and a knife in the right pocket can be the difference between life and death.

This term is also thrown around as a way to describe a system overwhelmed with corruption, which would function as any other government if it wasn’t for the overwhelming incentive to lie, cheat, and steal.

- **REAL:** _Gangs, guilds, and pirates. Otherwise, no state willingly calls itself a Kleptocracy._
- **FICTION:** _Tortuga (Pirates of the Caribbean)_

#### Fragile State
Rule Coming Undone– _“My kingdom for a horse.”_

A failed state (or fragile state) is defined as one that has disintegrated to the point where the basic conditions and responsibilities of a government no longer function properly. Various metrics are used to judge whether a state is failing, fragile, or failed. The following are signs of a failing state:

- Loss of legitimate authority to make unified decisions
- Loss of control of territory, or recognition of sovereignty
- Inability to provide public services or enforce laws
- Inability to interact as a full member of the international community.
- Decline of human rights, economy, security, public health, and sovereignty

When in this position, either the state that was will fracture, will devolve into mob rule, will be susceptible to foreign influence or conquering, or will over time and through suffering transition into a system that allows it recover. Recovery requires state development, which can come from either nation-building, war-making, or foreign aid.

- **REAL:** _Western Roman Empire, Mayan Civilization, French Monarchy (pre-revolution), Weimar Republic (1930s), East Germany (Cold War), Late USSR, Yugoslavia_
- **FICTION:** Kings Landing/Mad King (Game of Thrones), _Adro Monarchy (Powder Mage Trilogy)_

#### Cyclical Bureaucracy
Rule by Paperwork – _“Let me check with my superior.”_

A satirical sort of government that I invented one rainy day in my high school years. Inspired by the goblins of Harry Potter, and the Vogons of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, the idea of a massive bureaucracy consisting of 3000+ members where all acts of rule require the proper form. All forms are drafted, and then must be approved by the drafters superior. The superior must review and submit it to their superior. Forms eventually round the entire hierarchy of superiors until it reaches the last person, of whom the original drafter is the superior of. The cycle continues forever, until the timeline for submitting expires, or the conditions for Special Provision X is reached. …

Nobody knows the conditions for Special Provision X.
