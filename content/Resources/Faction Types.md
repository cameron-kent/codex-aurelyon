## What are the different types of factions?

In order for a faction to exist, there has to be a reason for people to organize themselves. They need a unifying purpose or goal. These goals can be:

- **Military** – Armies of battle hardened soldiers, knightly orders, revolutionaries, and mercenary companies. All manner of combat finesse, discipline, rigid structure, and a motivation to fight and defend the interest of the group by force. 
- **Religion** – Religious faiths, spiritual sects, cults, and holy orders. Spreading the faith, preserving tradition, converting unbelievers, and protecting against the interlopers and the faithless.
- **Political** – Emperors and kings, parties of ideologues, radicals and loyalists, aristocracy, traveling ambassadors, peace-keepers, and the corrupt. Those with the power to make administrative impact on a nation or region.
- **Economic** – Trading companies, merchant guilds, multi-national corporations, industry, and labor groups. All that glitters may not be gold, but it might as well be.
- **Guild** – Groups spanning all trades and professions, from gunsmiths to armorers, tailors to tanners, crafters and architects. Not to mention bards, lore-keepers, artists, curators, and the keepers of other secrets.
- **Cultural Identity** – Peoples bound together by ethnicity, class, societal status, region, traditions, and cultures. Birds of a feather flock together, and so fly their struggles, interests, and the passing on of their way of life.
- **Figurehead / House** – Charismatic leaders, wealthy elites, and prophets. Some individual rise to become great, and in their wake, stands a legion of followers who serve under their banner alone.
- **Criminal** – Pirates, town and city gangs, assassins and thief guilds, and those exiled from society. The world is filled with places for plunder, profit, and secrecy.

## How to build a faction (Some questions)

Now that we have some examples, let’s break down the process of building a faction. Like all other aspects of world-building, there is no one-size-fits-all method to accomplish this.
