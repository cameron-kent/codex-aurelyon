The Cult of the Five Heads stands as a formidable force dedicated to the worship and propagation of Tiamat's draconic supremacy, their ranks swelling with dragonkin, mercenaries, and tyrants drawn to the allure of conquest and domination. Embracing the draconic essence that courses through their veins, these fervent devotees seek to enforce the will of the Queen of Dragons upon the mortal realm, wielding the destructive power of their dragon ancestry to crush any who dare oppose them. Led by the insatiable hunger for power that burns within their draconic hearts, they spare no effort in their relentless pursuit of Tiamat's agenda, marshaling their forces with ruthless efficiency to subjugate nations, topple kingdoms, and bend lesser beings to their will. Guided by the promise of ascension and dominion under the banner of the Five-Headed Dragon, the Cult of the Five Heads wages war with fervent zeal, spreading fear and chaos wherever their shadow falls, for in the name of Tiamat, there is no room for mercy or compromise.
