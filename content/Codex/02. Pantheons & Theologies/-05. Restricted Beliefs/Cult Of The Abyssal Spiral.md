The Cult of the Abyssal Spiral stands as a dark fellowship, comprised of the most fervent adherents to the chaotic and nihilistic creed of Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion. Among its ranks are madmen, cultists, and nihilists who have willingly surrendered themselves to the all-consuming madness of their dread lord. Fuelled by a perverse desire to spread chaos and destruction, these twisted souls embrace the darkness that envelops their existence, reveling in the despair that accompanies the impending collapse of reality. With each act of wanton destruction, they seek to unravel the fabric of creation itself, paving the way for a new age of darkness and oblivion where Tharizdun's influence reigns supreme. Guided by the malevolent whispers of their dread lord, they march inexorably towards the abyss, heedless of the consequences of their actions and driven only by the insatiable hunger for annihilation that burns within their shattered souls.
