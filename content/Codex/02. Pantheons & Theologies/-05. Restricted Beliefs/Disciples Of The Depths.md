The Disciples of the Depths stand as a grim testament to the twisted ideology of Torog, the Tyrant Below, their ranks comprised of slavers, torturers, and lords of the underground realms. Embracing the creed of domination and subservience championed by their dark deity, these depraved individuals revel in the darkness and despair that permeate their existence. With ruthless efficiency, they seek to impose their will upon both the surface world and the subterranean domains, enslaving those they deem inferior and subjecting them to unspeakable horrors in the name of their dread lord. Guided by the malevolent whispers that echo through the endless caverns and labyrinthine tunnels, the Disciples of the Depths wield their power with cruel impunity, spreading fear and suffering wherever they tread. In the depths of the earth where Torog holds sway, they reign as masters of torment and despair, their depravity serving as a chilling reminder of the boundless cruelty that lurks within the heart of the Tyrant Below.
