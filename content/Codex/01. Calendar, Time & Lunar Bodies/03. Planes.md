## Material Plane
The Material Plane serves as the foundation of existence, where Aurelyon and its myriad realms unfold within the natural laws of space and time, anchoring the cosmos in tangible reality. It is here that mortal beings live out their lives, shaped by the ebb and flow of the world around them.
## Elemental Planes
The Elemental Planes are the primal crucibles of existence, where the fundamental forces of nature converge and collide in an eternal symphony of creation and destruction. Within these fiery realms, the elements of fire, water, earth, and air reign supreme, each vying for dominance in a never-ending cycle of elemental chaos. It was the primordial chaos thrust from the realms which collided on the Material Plane and birthed Aurelyon.
## e'Fae'rëal & Umbrafall

^feabce

The e'Fae'rëal and Umbrafall, twin reflections of Aurelyon, exist as parallel planes of existence, each embodying contrasting aspects of light and darkness. The e'Faereal flourishes with vibrant beauty and untamed wilderness, populated by the fae folk and other mystical beings, while the Umbrafall shrouds itself in perpetual gloom and despair, home to only the most resilient and shadowy denizens.
## Ethereal Plane
The Ethereal Plane, also known as the Veil, serves as the liminal space between life and death, where restless spirits and otherworldly entities linger, tethered to the mortal realm by unfinished business or lingering regrets.
## Astral Plane
The above planes exist within the same area of the Astral Sea, sometimes overlapping and buttressing in their realities. The below planes exist out in the farthest reaches of the Astral Sea, a vast unpredictable barren space.
## Outer Planes
The Outer Planes, mysterious realms of divine origin, are the cosmic domains of the Founding Divinities and the Dawnlight Deities, where their influence and power are most potent. Mortals speculate about these enigmatic realms, theorizing about the possibility of traversing their boundaries through powerful arcane means.
## Beyond Planes
Farther than the Outer Planes lies the Beyond, a realm shrouded in impenetrable darkness and silence, where the fabric of reality unravels and time loses all meaning. It is believed that ancient entities, older than time itself, may dwell within these unfathomable depths, venturing into the Astral Sea only on rare occasions.
## Demiplanes
Demiplanes, created through potent magical rituals, exist as isolated pockets of reality within the vast expanse of the Astral Sea. These self-contained dimensions offer refuge and sanctuary to those who possess the knowledge and power to access them, serving as havens for the arcane and divine alike.
