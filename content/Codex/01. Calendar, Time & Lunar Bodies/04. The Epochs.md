After a titanic struggle, the gods emerge victorious, defeating the Titans and banishing the surviving to elemental prisons within the planet.

The celestial realms tremble with the fury of divine battles, as gods clash in titanic struggles for supremacy. Amidst the chaos, an ancient and malevolent entity from the depths of the astral sea stirs from its aeons-long slumber, drawn to Aurelyon by the power of its gods. The gods unite in a desperate bid to repel the cosmic invader, risking everything in a battle that threatens to consume the world itself.

## Age Of Abandon
##### Year 0 P.S. ⇒ Present Day, 1468 P.S.
![[age of abandon.jpg|left|300|300]]As the Year of Falling Stars dawns upon Aurelyon, the skies are ablaze with a torrent of meteors, each blazing across the heavens like fiery heralds of impending doom. Their luminous trails cut through the darkness, casting an eerie glow upon the land below and marking the beginning of the end of an era. In a single cataclysmic event, the gods vanish from the mortal realm, their divine presence fading like wisps of smoke into the night sky. With their departure, the firmament is stripped bare of celestial guidance, leaving their followers to fend for themselves in a world suddenly plunged into uncertainty, darkness, and chaos. The once-proud temples and shrines stand silent and empty, their hallowed halls echoing with the absence of divine presence, while the faithful are left to grapple with the harsh reality of a world bereft of its divine protectors.
