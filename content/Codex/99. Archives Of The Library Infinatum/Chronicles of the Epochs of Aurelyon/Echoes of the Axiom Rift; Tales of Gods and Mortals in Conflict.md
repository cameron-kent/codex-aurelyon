As the mortal races flourished and their civilizations expanded across the face of Aurelyon, the divine pantheon found themselves embroiled in a profound disagreement regarding the fate and future of these burgeoning societies. Some gods advocated for a hands-off approach, believing that mortals should be granted the freedom to shape their own destinies and carve their own paths in the world. These deities championed the virtues of autonomy and self-determination, arguing that only through struggle and hardship could mortals truly grow and evolve.

Conversely, others argued for a more interventionist stance, asserting that mortals were in need of stricter guidance and governance to ensure their continued prosperity and well-being. These gods sought to exert greater control over the mortal races, enforcing laws and edicts intended to shape their societies in accordance with divine will and decree. They believed that without the firm hand of divine authority to guide them, mortals would inevitably succumb to chaos and ruin.

Amidst these conflicting ideologies, a third faction emerged, advocating for a drastic and radical solution to the perceived shortcomings of the mortal races. These extremist deities argued that mortals were fundamentally flawed and irredeemable, their societies tainted by corruption and sin. They believed that the only way to cleanse Aurelyon of this perceived impurity was to purge the mortal races entirely and start anew, wiping the slate clean and beginning again from scratch.

As tensions between these differing factions escalated, disputes turned into heated debates, and debates turned into outright conflict. The divine pantheon became fractured, with gods aligning themselves with like-minded deities and forging alliances to further their own agendas. Battles were fought in secret and in the open across the gods' native planes, as well as on the surface of Aurelyon itself, where mortals became unwitting pawns in the cosmic struggle for supremacy.
