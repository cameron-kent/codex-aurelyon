As the influx of gods to Aurelyon continued, a sense of urgency gripped the divine pantheon. Recognizing the potential for both greatness and peril in this fledgling world, a coalition of benevolent deities resolved to take action. Among them were Pelor, the radiant god of the sun, Sehanine, the ethereal goddess of the moon, Moradin, the stalwart god of the forge, and Corellon, the graceful god of magic and the elves. Together, they conceived a plan to empower mortal champions who would serve as beacons of hope and righteousness in the mortal realm.

From among the mortals of Aurelyon, eight individuals were chosen to serve as the champions of the Council of Eight, each imbued with a portion of their divine patron's power and purpose. These champions were to act as extensions of the gods' will, wielding their divine gifts in service of justice, compassion, and the greater good.

The Council of Eight was formed, comprising a diverse array of mortals who embodied the virtues and values of their divine patrons. Among them were two courageous human men, whose valor and determination made them natural leaders on the battlefield. Alongside them stood a human woman, her wisdom and compassion serving as a guiding light in times of darkness and despair.

From the dwarven clans came two stalwart champions, their strength and resilience forged in the fires of the mountains. These sons of stone stood firm against the tide of adversity, their loyalty unwavering in the face of adversity.

Representing the elven races were a High Elf man and a Wood Elf woman, embodiments of grace and harmony in the natural world. Their connection to the arcane and the wilderness made them powerful allies in the fight against darkness and corruption.

Rounding out the Council of Eight was a gnome man, whose ingenuity and resourcefulness knew no bounds. A master of invention and artifice, he brought his unique talents to bear in the service of his divine patrons, crafting wondrous contraptions and devising cunning strategies to outwit their foes.

Together, the Council of Eight stood as paragons of virtue and heroism, their deeds inspiring mortals across Aurelyon to aspire to greatness and righteousness. Through their courage, compassion, and unwavering dedication to the cause of good, they became legends in their own time, ensuring that the light of hope would never be extinguished in the mortal realm.
