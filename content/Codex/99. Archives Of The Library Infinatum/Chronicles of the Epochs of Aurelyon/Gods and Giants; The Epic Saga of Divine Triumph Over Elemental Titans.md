Before the gods could commence their divine work of shaping Aurelyon into a realm of splendor and order, they faced a formidable challenge: the elemental Titans who held dominion over the chaotic lands. These colossal beings, embodiments of raw elemental power, roamed the primordial world with unrivaled might, their very presence shaping the landscape and influencing the course of nature.

The conflict between the gods and the Titans was not a mere skirmish but a protracted war, spanning epochs and continents. The Titans, fierce and unyielding, fiercely resisted the incursion of the divine pantheon into their domain, rallying their elemental armies to repel the invaders.

Led by the most powerful among them, the Titans unleashed devastating storms, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions upon the forces of the gods, seeking to crush their divine foes beneath the weight of elemental fury. The very earth trembled and the skies raged as the titanic clash reverberated across the world.

However, the gods were not to be deterred. With Pelor's radiant light leading the way, they rallied their celestial host and marshaled their divine powers to confront the Titans in battle. Moradin's stalwart earth-shaping, Sehanine's ethereal moonlight, Kord's thunderous strength, Corellon's graceful magic, Bahamut's righteous fury, Erathis' strategic wisdom, and Asmodeus's cunning machinations all played a crucial role in turning the tide of the conflict.

Through sheer determination, valor, and divine prowess, the gods slowly but steadily gained ground against the Titans, pushing them back and breaking their hold over the land. The war reached its climax in a cataclysmic confrontation, where the very fabric of reality seemed to tremble under the weight of the gods' and Titans' titanic clash.

Ultimately, the gods emerged victorious, though at great cost. Some Titans were vanquished in battle, their elemental essence scattered to the winds. Others, deemed too powerful to be destroyed, were imprisoned within arcane wards and elemental prisons, their immense strength forever sealed away from the mortal world.

With the Titans defeated and the world now firmly in their grasp, the gods could at last begin their sacred task of shaping Aurelyon into a realm of divine beauty and order, ushering in the Age of Divine Dominion.
