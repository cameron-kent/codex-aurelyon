Aurelyon, bathed in the ethereal glow of its twin moons, Nastra and Alturis, experiences celestial phenomena that captivate the hearts and minds of its inhabitants. Every 966 days, these two celestial bodies align in a mesmerizing event known as the Lunaeris, where Nastra, the large white moon, and Alturis, the small blue moon, converge in the night sky. This alignment often evokes comparisons to a celestial eye, with Alturis appearing as a pupil before the radiant gaze of Nastra. However, the rarity of celestial occurrences doesn't end there. Approximately every 161 years, the Lunaeris coincides with a solar eclipse, giving rise to the grand spectacle known as the Lux Lunaeris. During this extraordinary event, the celestial eye takes on a mesmerizing appearance, encircled by a burning ring of solar eclipse, casting an otherworldly light upon the leylines of Aurelyon. As if touched by magic, auroras dance along the weaving leylines, painting the skies with vibrant hues of celestial energy. For sages and scholars attuned to the mysteries of the arcane, the Lux Lunaeris offers a unique opportunity to tap into the raw power of the weave, unlocking hidden potentials and unraveling the secrets of the cosmos.
