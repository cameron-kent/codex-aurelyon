As the [[Council Of Eight]] embarked on their mission to bring order and structure to the nascent world of Aurelyon, they recognized the necessity of establishing a unified system of timekeeping to mark the passage of days, months, and years. Collaborating with divine wisdom and insight, the councilors convened to devise the inaugural Aurelyon calendar, a celestial testament to their shared vision of harmony and unity. In a gesture of humility and reverence, they chose to immortalize their own contributions by naming the months after themselves. Thus, the Aurelyon calendar was born, with each month bearing the name of one of the councilors: Aldrian, Thaddeuar, Lyran, Borinuar, Thoruan, Ladrelan, Elowem, and Merrickem. Over time, this calendar became a symbol of the council's enduring legacy, a testament to their relentless dedication to bringing enlightenment and order to the mortal realm.

Eager to refine the Aurelyon calendar further, the Council of Eight turned their attention to the division of time into days, seeking to infuse each day with meaning reflective of the elemental and celestial forces that governed their world. Drawing inspiration from nature's elements and celestial bodies, they named the days after fundamental aspects of existence. Thus, the Aurelyon week came to consist of days such as Soldurn, in homage to the radiant sun; Lunedurn, paying tribute to the ethereal moons; Terrdurn, symbolizing the steadfast earth; Aethdurn, representing the boundless air; Pyrdurn, evoking the primal fire; Auqdurn, celebrating the life-giving waters; Neumdurn, acknowledging the inevitability of death; and Caeldurn, embracing the essence of life itself. Through this naming, the Aurelyon calendar became a reflection of the cosmic balance and harmony that the Council of Eight sought to instill in their world, a tribute to the interconnectedness of all things and the enduring power of creation and renewal.
