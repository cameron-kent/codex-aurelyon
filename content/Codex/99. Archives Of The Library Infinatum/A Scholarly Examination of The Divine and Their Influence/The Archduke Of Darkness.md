![[Asmodeus.jpg|left|350|350]]Asmodeus, the Archduke of Darkness, stands as a towering figure in the pantheon of Aurelyon's deities, revered and feared in equal measure for his cunning intellect, inscrutable machinations, and unyielding pursuit of power. Known as the Lord of the Nine Hells, his influence extends far beyond the confines of his infernal domain, permeating the mortal world with his dark allure and tempting promises of power and dominion. His worshippers, drawn to the promise of earthly delights and infernal favour, pay homage to their dark lord through rituals of blood and sacrifice, seeking his blessings in exchange for their unwavering loyalty.

The symbol of Asmodeus is an emblem of authority and power, embodying the principles of dominance and control that define his domain. At its core lies a pentagram, its points sharp and angular, representing the five aspects of infernal mastery: manipulation, deception, coercion, domination, and punishment. Encircling the pentagram is a coiled serpent, its sinuous form symbolic of Asmodeus' serpentine allure and seductive charm, which ensnare mortals in webs of temptation and corruption. Above the serpent hovers a crown, a regal adornment that signifies Asmodeus' status as the undisputed ruler of the Nine Hells and the architect of infernal law.

Religions devoted to Asmodeus vary in their practices and beliefs, but all share a common reverence for their dark lord and a dedication to furthering his infernal agenda. Some sects worship Asmodeus as a deity of order and law, viewing his ruthless enforcement of infernal contracts as a necessary means of maintaining cosmic balance. Others venerate him as a patron of ambition and ambition, seeking to emulate his cunning and ruthlessness in their own pursuit of power.

![[_asmodeus.jpg|right|300|300]]One notable religion that venerates Asmodeus is the [[Order Of The Crimson Coil]], a secretive sect whose members pledge their souls to the Archdevil in exchange for arcane knowledge and worldly power. Led by high priests known as Hierarchs, the Order operates clandestinely, exerting its influence behind the scenes to manipulate politics, commerce, and the affairs of mortals. The teachings of the Order emphasize the importance of ambition, cunning, and ruthlessness in the pursuit of one's goals, reflecting the ideals espoused by their infernal patron.

In conclusion, the influence of Asmodeus looms large over Aurelyon, casting a shadow of darkness and deceit upon the mortal realm. Whether worshipped as a deity of order or a harbinger of chaos, Asmodeus commands the loyalty and fear of mortals and devils alike, his dark influence shaping the course of history and destiny itself.
