Within the annals of Aurelyon's divine history, the pantheon is often delineated into two distinct groups, each bearing its own unique significance in the grand tapestry of celestial influence. The first cohort of deities, revered as "The Founding Divinities," consists of the illustrious beings who first set foot upon Aurelyon's pristine shores, heralding the dawn of the Age of Divine Dominion. Among their hallowed ranks stand the radiant Pelor, whose golden light illuminates the heavens; the stalwart Moradin, whose hammer shapes the very earth itself; the enigmatic Sehanine, whose moonlit grace dances through the night sky; the thunderous Kord, whose valorous spirit echoes across the battlefield; the graceful Corellon, whose arcane mastery weaves magic into the fabric of reality; the wise Erathis, whose guiding hand shapes the course of mortal civilizations; the noble Bahamut, whose draconic majesty inspires awe and reverence; and the cunning Asmodeus, whose infernal influence casts a shadow over the mortal realm. These venerable deities, drawn to Aurelyon by its untapped potential and divine radiance, laid the foundation for the realm's spiritual destiny, shaping its nascent landscape with their boundless power and unfathomable wisdom.

In contrast, the second group of divine beings, often referred to as "The Dawnlight Deities," arrived in Aurelyon's embrace during the fledgling stages of its divine dominion. Drawn by the allure of Aurelyon's burgeoning potential and the celestial energies that coursed through its veins, these deities brought with them their own unique perspectives, powers, and agendas. While some came with fanfare and revelatory displays of divine might, others arrived in quiet reverence, their presence a subtle undercurrent in the ever-shifting currents of divine influence. Among the ranks of these dawnlight deities are myriad gods and goddesses, each leaving their own indelible mark upon Aurelyon's spiritual landscape. From the verdant domains of nature to the fiery depths of the underworld, their divine portfolios span the breadth of mortal experience, guiding and shaping the destinies of those who walk in their shadow. Together, these divine newcomers stand as testament to Aurelyon's enduring allure, a beacon of hope and opportunity in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
